Hungrypotamus is a project that will be coming together at Betaspring's [Digital Meets Physical Hardware Hackathon](http://betaspring.com/blog/2012/01/09/next-digital-meets-physical-hardware-hackathon-jan-28) on January 28th, 2012.  Contact [mattgillooly](http://twitter.com/mattgillooly) for more details or to become involved.

The goal of the project is to allow remote players to use their internet-connected devices to play [Hungry Hungry Hippos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungry_Hungry_Hippos) against other players on a real, physical game board.


Current Status

Matt is working on some aspects of the web software before the hackfest.  So far, this is limited to [Cucumber](http://cukes.info) features to specify the planned functionality.  If you are familiar with Cucumber, and you are so inclined, please leave some comments on the GitHub commits where you think things could be improved.
